The underlying reason for this behavior is that the app samples parameters from the parameter ranges\nand plots the median of this often small sample. Since these parameters affect exponential growth, small variation in\nthe sample can result in large variation in the output. We now generate an additional trajectory where each\nparameter is set to its median value. This trajectory should behave like the median trajectory in a large sample\nand is plotted instead of the sample median.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`2020-06-09: Bugfix in mitigationInterval sampling.`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Our simulations include parameter uncertainty by sampling parameters from user-specified ranges.\nFor somewhat subtle reasons, this sampling procedure behaved differently in the production and the development\nenvironment which result in using only one realization of the mitigation parameters.\nThis was patched in `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/neherlab/covid19_scenarios/pull/729/commits/35ba172229c944fa0b88efbd1e112ecdcd71e97f\"\n      }}>{`commit`}</a>{`.\nAs a result, you should expect that the confidence intervals increased, while the jumpiness from one realization to another\nshould be reduced.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`2020-05-22: Changes to the parameter presets`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Our parameter presets for R0, the initial number of cases, and interventions are meant to facilitate adjusting a\nscenario to the developments in your community. They are not sophisticated inferences -- this would\nrequire dedicated procedures for different regions that each come with their own peculiarities in reporting.\nBut with more data available, we can estimate more parameters directly from data that should result in better\nstarting points.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We now estimate the initial R0, the Re in the last three weeks of available data, and time point at which the R0 changed.\nTogether with estimates of the initial number of cases, the resulting fits track data for communities with\nrobust data fairly well. We hope this facilitates further manual optimization.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`2020-04-29: Allow for parameter uncertainty`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Since release 1.2.0, parameters that affect the growth rate (R0 and the mitigation efficacy) are specified as ranges.\nSimulation results are very sensitive to these parameters and we wanted to make this clear. Instead of one number, the\nuser now has to specify two numbers that indicate the plausible lower and upper values of the parameter. The model will\nthen randomly sample a number of combinations of the parameters, each uniformly from the range and run multiple\nsimulations. The results graph show the median and a shaded area indicating the 20th and 80th percentile. By setting\nupper and lower ranges of a parameter to the same value, the simulation will revert back to its previous version.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`2020-04-06: Scenario parameters estimated from data`}</h3>\n    <p>{`We have begun fitting a few individualized parameters for scenarios based upon COVID-19 case data provided we have\naccess to a trusted source updated daily.

This large step size results in inaccuracies, in particular\nas we are using first order integration scheme. This step size is now reduced to 0.05 days. This can change the output\nof the model by a few percent.

The single category\nimplicitly assumes that individuals spend an exponentially distributed time in the \"exposed but not yet infectious\"\nstate. The peak of the exponential distribution is at zero implying that many individuals spend a very short time in\nthis category while others spend a much longer time.
