# About

The Outbreak Explorer is a web application that supports "What if?" inquiry about the COVID-19 outbreak in Leon County, FL.
The Outbreak Explorer builds on the <LinkExternal url="http://covid19-scenarios.org">COVID-19 Scenarios</LinkExternal> project with a focus on agent-based models. 
Presently, the application is using a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model with additional categories for infected but not infectious,
hospitalized, in critical condition, and dead.  The source code for the Outbreak Explorer is freely available at <LinkExternal url="https://github.com/cesarr/outbreak-explorer">github.com/cesarr/outbreak-explorer</LinkExternal>.

## Model Description

The model in version 0.2.0 works as follows:

 - Susceptible individuals are exposed/infected through contact with infectious individuals. Each infectious individual causes on average $R_0$ secondary infections while they are infectious.
Transmissibility of the virus could have seasonal variation which is parameterized with the parameter
"seasonal forcing" (amplitude) and "peak month" (month of most efficient transmission).

 - exposed individuals progress to a symptomatic/infectious state after an average latency. The progression happens in three stages to ensure the distribution of time spent in the exposed compartment is more realistic than a simple exponential.

 - infectious individuals recover or progress to severe disease. The ratio of recovery to severe progression depends on age

 - severely sick individuals either recover or deteriorate and turn critical. Again, this depends on the age

 - critically ill individuals either get admitted to the intesive care unit (ICU), if space is available, or are placed in an overflow compartment. Younger age-groups are given preferential access to the ICU.

 - critically ill individuals either return to a regular hospital bed or die. Again, this depends on the age and on whether they receive intensive care or not.


The individual parameters of the model can be changed to allow exploration of different scenarios.

COVID-19 is much more severe in the elderly and proportion of elderly in a community is therefore an important determinant of the overall burden on the health care system and the death toll.  The model uses the age distribution of the United States.

## Seasonality

Many respiratory viruses such as influenza, common cold viruses (including other coronaviruses) have a pronounced seasonal variation in incidence which is in part driven by climate variation through the year.  The seasonal variation is modeled using a sinusoidal function with an annual period. This approach is a simple starting point for considering seasonal variation.

## Transmission Reduction

The Outbreak Explorer supports exploring temporal variation in the reduction of transmission by infection control measures.
This is implemented as a curve through time that can be dragged by the mouse to modify the assumed transmission. The curve is used to change the transmission relative to the base line parameters for $R_0$ and seasonality.
Several studies attempt to estimate the effect of different aspects of social distancing and infection control on the rate of transmission.
A report by [Wang et al](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030593v1) estimates a step-wise reduction of $R_0$ from above three to around 1 and then to around 0.3 due to successive measures implemented in Wuhan.


## Model Details
The model includes the following subpopulations:

  * Susceptible individuals [$S$] are exposed to the virus by contact with an infected individual.
  * Exposed individuals [$E$] progress towards a symptomatic state on average time $t_l$
  * Infected individuals [$I$] infect an average of $R_0$ secondary infections. On a time-scale of $t_i$, infected individuals either recover or progress towards hospitalization.
  * Hospitalized individuals [$H$] either recover or worsen towards a critical state on a time-scale of $t_h$.
  * Critical individuals [$C$] model ICU usage. They either return to the hospital state or die [$D$] on a time-scale of $t_c$
  * Recovered individuals [$R$] can not be infected again.

Subpopulations are delineated by age classes, indexed by $a$, to allow for variable transition rates dependent upon age.
The following system of differential equations are solved numerically to generate trajectories of the subpopulations:

<div>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS_{a}(t)}{dt} & = - N^{-1}\beta_a(t) S_a(t)\sum_{b}I_b(t) \\
\frac{dE_{a}^1(t)}{dt} & = N^{-1}\beta_a(t) S_a(t)\sum_{b}I_b(t) - 3E_{a}^1(t)/t_l \\
\frac{dE_{a}^2(t)}{dt} & =  3E_{a}^1(t)/t_l - 3E_{a}^2(t)/t_l \\
\frac{dE_{a}^3(t)}{dt} & =  3E_{a}^2(t)/t_l - 3E_{a}^3(t)/t_l \\
\frac{dI_{a}(t)}{dt} & = 3E_{a}^3(t)/t_l - I_a(t)/t_i \\
\frac{dH_{a}(t)}{dt} & = (1-m_a) I_a(t)/t_i + (1-f_a) C_a(t)/t_c - H_a(t)/t_h \\
\frac{dC_{a}(t)}{dt} & = c_a H_a(t)/t_h - C_a(t)/t_c \\
\frac{dR_{a}(t)}{dt} & = m_a I_a(t)/t_i + (1-c_a)H_a(t)/t_h \\
\frac{dD_{a}(t)}{dt} & = f_a C_a(t)/t_c
\end{aligned}
$$

</div>

The parameters of the model fall into three categories: a time dependent infection rate $\beta(t)$ time scales of transition to a different subpopulation $t_l$, $t_i$, $t_h$, $t_c$, and age specific parameters $m_a$, $c_a$ and $f_a$ that determine relative rates of different outcomes.
The latency time from infection to infectiousness is $t_l$, the time an individual is infectious after which he/she either recovers or falls severely ill is $t_i$, the time a sick person recovers or deteriorates into a critical state is $t_h$, and the time a person remains critical before dying or stabilizing is $t_c$.
The fraction of infectious that are asymptomatic or mild is $m_a$, the fraction of severe cases that turn critical is $c_a$, and the fraction of critical cases that are fatal is $f_a$.
One aspect of the model is not reflected in the above system of equations: If the number of critically ill patients exceeds the capacity of ICU, they are placed in an overflow category $O$.
Individuals in this category die at a higher rate.
Otherwise, the flow is the same as for category $C_a$.
Patients are allocated to the overflow category in a manner that gives priority to younger patients.


The transmission rate $\beta_a(t)$ is given by

<div>

$$
  \beta_a(t) = R_0 \zeta_a M(t) (1+\varepsilon \cos(2\pi (t-t_{max})))/t_i
$$

</div>

where $\zeta_a$ is the degree to which particular age groups are isolated from the rest of the population, $M(t)$ is the time course of mitigation measures, $\varepsilon$ is the amplitude of seasonal variation in transmissibility, and $t_{max}$ is the time of the year of peak transmission.

Agent-based models are under development.  This page will be updated as we add new models to the application.
